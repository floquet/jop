This file is ${SACHOME}/doc/exmples/convolve/README

In that directory, issue the command

    ./run_convolvef.sh

This will do the following:

1.  \rm *.sac brune convolvef convolvec

2.  Create the input files for convolve
    - Some from SAC and one from a Fortran program that creates a Brune pulse.

3.  Compile the Fortran program convolvef

4.  Run convolvef first with a triangle pulse and an impulse waveform for
    both discrete and time-series options.

5.  Run convolvef for a synthetic waveform and both discrete and time-series
    for a triangle pulse and then with a brune pulse for the time-series
    option.

Eight .sac files are created.  If they all worked, they will be the same
as in ./sample-run.  This is checked using sacdiff.

If one now enters    ./run_convolvec.sh it will repeat the steps but for the
C program convolvec.
