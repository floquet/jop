This file is ${SACHOME}/doc/exmples/time_shift/README

In this directory, issue the command  \rm -f *.sac time_shift
This will clear out results from previous runs.  Then issue the command

    run_time_shift.sh

This will do the following:

1. fg seismo
2. rtrend ; taper
3. change IZTYPE from IB to IO
      (which is necessary if SAC time-shift is to work and on input IZTYPE=IB)
4. lowpass filter the waveform
5. write lpco5np4.sac
6. read lpco5np4.sac ; rtr ; taper
7. Use macro ${SACHOME}/macros/sac-ts.m to time-shift lpco5np4.sac by -0.05
   and then writes out the result as seismo_lpco5np4_sacts.sac
8. commpile program time_shift
9. Run it to time-shift seismo_lpco5np4.sac by -0.05

Four .sac files are created.  If all worked, they will be the same
as in ./sample-run.  This is tested with calls to sacdiff with the q opton so 
that it only reports if two files differ. If one finds that two files differ, 
leaving out the -q option in sacdiff will show explicit differences.
