This directory contains a sub-directory demo.  See demo/README for
details.  The original version of the macros were written in the early
90s when Sun Solaris was the most used platform, sunwindows was the
default screen display, and SGF files were the only way to get hard
copies of SAC-created plots.  Starting with v101.6, the macros have
been updated and are included because they remain a potentially useful
that for both showing off some of SAC's capabilities and providing
some sample coding in macros.

The original version included a second set of macros that demonstrated
some of SAC's features.  They are not included here because there are
now other suites of macros and programs that serve this purpose.
These include:

1. Seismic Analysis Code Example Program (sac/doc/examples/README)
2. Help files: sac/auc/help/user_man/macros; sac/aux/help/cut; and
   sac/aux/help/cutim
3. sac/t/testsuite/README.check (currently available only with the
   source distribution)

There are additional macros in this directory that might be of use.
Their names and comment lines explain their actions.
