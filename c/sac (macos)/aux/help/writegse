WRITEGSE
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Write data files in GSE 2.0 format from memory to disk.

SYNTAX
------
::

  WRITEGSE {TYPE} {SOURCE ON|OFF|str} {DIR name} filename

INPUT
-----
   :TYPE:  Determines wether the data are written in ascii integer format
       (INT) or as compressed gse format (CM6). Default is INT.

   :SOURCE str:  str is a string 20 characters or less specifying the
       institution at which the GSE file was written.  str is
       written in the MSG_ID line of the resultant GSE file.

   :DIR name:  The directory in which to write the gsefile.  This directory
       name is the same one that is used in WRITE_ command.

   :filename: The name of the gse file to be written.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------
::

  WRITEGSE INT SOURCE OFF

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Writes all data in memory to a single file according to the GSE 2.0 data format

  The following GSE Data messages are written:
   - WAVEFORM
   - STATION
   - CHANNEL
   - ARRIVAL
   - ORIGIN

  Waveforms are written in INT format:  floating point data is truncated to the
  nearest integer.

  **Note**  There is no way in GSE 2.0 to associate ORIGIN data with a
  waveform, so SAC's READGSE_ command does not read ORIGIN data, but
  WRITEGSE_ writes it.

  **Note**  SAC does not currently read nor write DETECTIONS information.
  Therefore, ARRIVAL information is not associated with specific channels.
