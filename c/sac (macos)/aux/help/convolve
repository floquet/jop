DESCRIPTION
-----------

 In seismology, convolution is used in two ways:

    1) convolving a pulse shape with a time-series, and
    2) convolving a response with a time series (or, more typically,
       deconvolving a response from a time series)

  The equation for convolution takes a simple form in both the time
  and frequency domains; (1) is more easily described in the time
  domain, while (2) in the frequency domain.  The CONVOLVE function
  here is oriented towards (1).  Function TRANSFER_ is more
  appropriate for (2).

  There are three ways to run CONVOLVE: (1) PULSE: read in N files
  and convolve one of them with all the others; (2) file: read in N
  files and convolve all of them with a file not among them: (3)
  Using a PREDEFINED FUNCTION (see below).  Previous to SAC v102.0,
  the PULSE method was the only option, so we start there.

  The pulse file is convolved with all other time-series files in
  memory using the discretized version of the following equation::

      conv(tau) = INT ( f(t) g(tau - t) ) dt,

  where f is the pulse file, g any from among the other signals in
  memory, and INT means integration (summation) over all times t. All
  signals in memory must have the same DELTA. The number of points in
  f, the pulse shape, cannot be greater than the number of points in
  any other file in memory. If NPTS(g) is the number of points in g
  and NPTS(f) the number in f, the number in conv is
  NPTS(g)+NPTS(f)-1. The start time for each output conv will be the
  same as B(g).  Centering on the pulse shapes eliminates time shifts
  introduced by convolution.  If CENTERED is OFF, B(f) = 0.0.
  CENTERED ON should only be used for time-symmetric pulses.  As an
  example, let synthetic.sac be a synthetic time series created by a
  progra  such as WKBJ, consisting of spikes with time offsets,
  amplitudes, and polarities representing phase arrivals.  Let that
  file be called synthetic.sac.  One wants to compare that synthetic
  with an observed sesimogram, and one creates a pulse file p_arrival.sac::

      SAC> r p_arrival.sac synthetic.sac
      SAC> PULSE 1 convolve CENTERED OFF

FILE OPTION
-----------

  Given the same two files::

      SAC> r synthetic.sac
      SAC> convolve p_arrival.sac CENTER OFF

PREDEFINED FUNCTIONS
--------------------
  The option to convolve with TRI and GAUSS automatically computes
  these function with the correct time samplings.  For GAUSS or TRI,
  there is no pulse-shape file read in; the predefined function takes
  the place of f(t) in the above equation.  Both functions are
  normalized such that they integrate to 1.0 and should not add
  amplitude (or "moment" in the language of sources).  Both functions
  are time-symmetric. If the exponent in GAUSS(t) is -0.5(t/v)^2, v is
  the standard deviation.

  Say one wants to look at file synthetic.sac simply as a spike series
  (no source pulse). The file may have Gibbs phenomena accompanying
  each arrival.  Convolving synthetic.sac with a predefined function
  will result in a cleaner looking seismogram::

      SAC> r synthetic.sac
      SAC> convolve GAUSS 0.04 CENTERED ON
      or
      SAC> r synthetic.sac
      SAC> convolve TRI 0.04 CENTERED ON

  All three cases (source, gauss, tri) are shown in the figure below.
  A Brune pulse is used as the p_arrival pulse.  No relative scaling
  has been done except for the source pulse.

RELATION TO CORRELATE
---------------------
  Note the similarity in the convolve equation and the one in CORRELATE_.
  Many convolve routines, including the original one in SAC, mistakenly
  use this similarity in deriving the procedure for convolution by simply
  perturbing the procedure used in CORRELATE_. The time series from a
  convolution (conv in the equation above) is typically a replacement time
  series for the time series g; for example, adding a pulse shapee to a
  synthetic seismogram.  The relative times for f and g are not used in
  CORRELATE_, but in convolution they may play a role.
