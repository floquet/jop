DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command controls the display of time pick information on most SAC plots.
   These time picks identify previously defined times of interest such as phase
   arrivals, event origin, etc.  When this display is on, each defined time pick
   is displayed on the plot at the time of the pick with a time pick id near the
   line.  The time pick id is a header variable 8 characters in length.  KA, KF,
   KO, and KTn are the time pick ids for A, F, O, and Tn respectively.  If the
   time pick id is not defined, the name of the pick itself is used.  Each pick
   may be displayed as a vertical line, a horizontal line, or a cross.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To display time picks T4, T5, and T6 as crosses and to change the height and
  width of the crosses::

      SAC> PICKS T4 C T5 C T6 C W 0.3 H 0.1

  Other time pick displays will remain unchanged.
