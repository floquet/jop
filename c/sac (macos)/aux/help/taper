TAPER
+++++

SUMMARY
-------
Applies a symmetric taper to each end of data.

SYNTAX
------
::

  TAPER {TYPE HANNING|HAMMING|COSINE},{WIDTH v}

INPUT
-----
   :TYPE HANNING:  Apply a Hanning taper.

   :TYPE HAMMING:  Apply a Hamming taper.

   :TYPE COSINE:  Apply a cosine taper.

   :WIDTH v:  Set the taper width on each end to v.  This is a value
       between 0.0 and 0.5.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------
::

  TAPER TYPE HANNING WIDTH 0.05

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   A taper is a monotonically varying function between zero and one.  It is
   applied in a symmetric manner to the data such that the signal is zero for
   the first and last data points and increases smoothly to its original value
   at an interior point relative to each end.

   The COSINE option here is computed using the sin() function as::

      DATA(J) = DATA(J) * SIN(OMEGA*J) where OMEGA = PI/(2*N)

   where  N is the length of the taper on each end, and J runs from 1 to N.

   The general form for the Hanning or Hamming taper is::

     DATA(J)=DATA(J)*(F0-F1*COS(OMEGA*(J))

   This equation would be applied to the left-hand side of each signal.  A
   symmetric one is applied to the right hand side.  The following table defines
   the various parameters used in the different tapers.
