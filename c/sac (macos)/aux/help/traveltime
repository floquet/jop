TRAVELTIME
++++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Computes traveltimes of selected phases for pre-defined velocity models.
This routine has the same source code as SSS/TRAVELTIME.  If one
is in SSS, one can use different plotting routines.  For an exampole, see
SSSTRAVELTIME_.


SYNTAX
------
::

   TRAVELTIME {MODEL string} {ONLINE} {VERBOSE | QUIET} {PICKS number}
       {PHASE phase list}  {CLEAR} {ONRECORD ON|OFF} {M | KM}


INPUT
-----

   :MODEL: iasp91 [default], ak135.  Traveltimes are calculated using
     the *iaspei-tau* procedures and traveltime tables.  (For further
     information, see documentation referenced below.)

   :ONLINE: Retrieve traveltimes from the IRIS Traveltime Web Service.
     This uses Crotwell's TauP Toolkit internally. In addition to
     *iasp91* and *ak135*, it includes model *prem*.  Also, it
     includes additional phases, and some phase groupings are not the
     same as for the *iaspei-tau* tables used by SAC. (For further
     information, see documentation referenced below.)

   :VERBOSE | QUIET: If VERBOSE is among the options in the TRAVELTIME
     command, phase arrival times are displayed relative to both the
     origin time (O) and the first-point time (B).  If instead,
     QUIET is among the options, nothing is displayed.  VERBOSE is
     the default.

   :PICKS: There are 10 time picks in the SAC header: t0 to t9.  If
     the number is n (0<=n<=9), the first phase will be at Tn. The
     default is n=0.  If PICKS is included among the options and if
     phases are within the time range of and seismogram in memory, the
     picks will be included in the header for that seismogram and will
     be displayed in subsequent plots such as PLOT1_ and PLOTPK_.  The
     default is not to have PICKS on, but if PICKS is turned on, it
     will remain on for subsequent runs with the same data set.
     Traveltimes are calculated relative to the origin (O) but the
     displayed and stored Tn times are relative to (B).

   :PHASE: List of phases for which times are displayed (unless QUIET
     is turned on).  Phase names are generally case sensitive.  As of
     SAC v102.0, *verbose ... phase* displays phases in chronological
     order, and the sorting is done before comparison with PICKS list
     If *PICKS n* is among the options, the phase arrival times and
     their times and labels will be added to the header starting at
     Tn.  If n is 0, one can have up to 10 phases put in the header
     and available for subsequent plots.  If n is 8, one can have at
     most 2 new phases added to the header.

   :ONRECORD ON|OFF: If specified as ONRECORD ON, phases are displayed
     (VERBOSE) and/or included as a PICK if the arrival time is
     between (B) and (E) for each station. ONRECORD OFF is the Default

   :CLEAR: Clears the phase list from previous runs. An empty phase
     list will be populated with the DEFAULT phases (see below) or
     values taken from the environment variable SAC_TRAVELTIME_PHASES.
     (See below.)  In the options, CLEAR must come before PHASE

   :M | KM:  If M is among the options, SAC interprets EVDP as being in
     meters.  If KM is displayed, EVDP is interpreted as being in
     kilometers. M was the default in SAC until 2005.  For all runs of
     *TRAVELTIME VERBOSE*, the depth is printed to the screen so it is
     obvious whether meters or kilometers were used

   :DEFAULT VALUES: MODEL iasp91 ONRECORD OFF KM PHASE P S Pn Pg Sn Sg

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   All waveforms in memory must have event and station locations defined as well
   as the event depth and the origin time.

   The traveltime tables use the stored degree-distance measure (GCARC), which
   is calculated from the event and station latitudes and longitudes using
   spherical-triangle geometry after converting geographic latitudes to
   geocentric.

   A quick way to find out all the possible phases that could be be
   visible on a seismogram according to TRAVELTIME, use *phase all*, e.g. ::

     SAC> read my-seismogram
     SAC> traveltime verbose phase all
     SAC> traveltime verbose onrecord on clear phase all

  The second traveltime command displays only arrivals that are between (B)
  and (E) for *my-seismogram*.  The *clear* option removes phase data from
  memory for the previous call .

  As discussed in DATAGEN_, seismograms from a deep-focus event have
  been added: ${SACHOME}/aux/datagen/deep/.  Arrivals are sharp, and
  several converted phases can be seen.  We use that event to
  demonstrate how to use TRAVELTIME::

     SAC> datagen sub deep bla.r
     SAC> lh b e o gcarc evdp
        b = 5.911000e+02                        e = 1.499100e+03
        o = 0.000000e+00                    gcarc = 8.627435e+01
        evdp = 6.110000e+02
     SAC> traveltime verbose picks 0 onrecord on phase all
        traveltime: depth: 611.000 km
        ...
        traveltime: setting phase SKSac    at 1265.9326 s [ t = 1265.9326 s ] t9
        ...
     SAC> traveltime picks 9 clear phase SKS
        traveltime: depth: 611.000 km
        traveltime: error finding phase SKSdf
        traveltime: setting phase SKSac    at 1265.9326 s [ t = 1265.9326 s ] t9

  In the traveltime call, arrival SKSac was the 10th arrival  so would be the
  last stored pick.  If *clear* had not been included in the second command, the
  VERBOSE output would have been incorrect.  (Try it.)  Prior to SAC v102.0,
  *phase SKS* would have returned *error finding phase SKS*.

  Next are the commands and an output plot for a run using the radial
  component for four stations and six phases.  Because plot command
  *P1* plots traces from top-to-bottom in the order read in, we
  manually re-ordered the files so that distance increases from first
  to last.  Phase sPP is not in the *isasp-tau* tables but is in the
  ONLINE *tau-p* tables.  (A nice feature for *SAC TRAVELTIME* is the
  ability to combine phases from multiple traveltime table in a single
  plot::

     SAC> datagen sub deep  kev.r kip.r pas.r bla.r
     SAC> rtr
     SAC> traveltime quiet online picks 0 phase sPP
     SAC> traveltime  picks 1 phase P pP sP S sS SKS
     SAC> FILEID LOCATION UL TYPE LIST KSTCMP
     SAC> TITLE 'Sakhalin Island Event: &1,KZDATE&, Depth is &1,EVDP& KM'
     SAC> p1
     SAC> save sakhalin-picks-p1.pdf

  .. figure:: ./sakhalin-picks-p1.png
   :width: 90%

  In SSSTRAVELTIME_ a plot is created for the same seismograms and
  phases using PLOTRECORDSECTION_.

DEFAULT PHASES
--------------

  The default phases for TRAVELTIME are set as local crustal phases:
  "P S Pn Pg Sn Sg".  If a different set of default phases is desired
  the environment variable SAC_TRAVELTIME_PHASES can be set to override
  the default.  The variable is comma or space delimited. For teleseismic
  data, one might use "P pP sS S pS sS PP SS".  An alternative is to use
  "all" to capture as many phases as possible.

  **Note**:Environmental variables must be set outside of SAC.
  In the *sh* shell, for *all*, enter *export SAC_TRAVELTIME_PHASES-"all"*.
  For shell *csh*: *setenv SAC_TRAVELTIME_PHASES "all"*.
