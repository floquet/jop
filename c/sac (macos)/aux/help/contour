CONTOUR
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Produces contour plots of data in memory.

SYNTAX
------
::

  CONTOUR {ASPECT ON|OFF}

INPUT
-----
   :ASPECT {ON}:  Turn aspect ratio option on.  When this option is on,
       the viewport of the contour plot will be adjusted to maintain the y
       to x aspect ratio of the data.

   :ASPECT OFF:  Turn aspect ratio option off.  When off, the full
       viewport is used.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------
::

  CONTOUR  ASPECT  OFF

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   This command can be used to produce a contour plot of the of any other
   two-dimensional array data, including the output of the SPECTROGRAM_ command.
   The SAC data plotted by this command must of of file type `XYZ` (SAC header
   variable IFTYPE set to `IXYZ`).  Several commands control how the data is
   displayed: ZLEVELS_ for the spacing and number of contour levels, ZLINES_ for
   linestyles, ZLABELS_ for contour labeling, ZTICKS_ for directional tick marks,
   and ZCOLORS_ for line colors.  Depending upon the contouring options selected,
   two different contouring algorithms are used.  A fast scan method is used if
   no only solid linestyles are selected and no tick marks or labels are
   requested.  Otherwise, a slower method, where entire line segments are first
   assembled before they are drawn, is used.  You may want to use the fast scan
   method for a quick look at your data and then select other options for a
   final version.

EXAMPLES
--------
   In the first example (shown below) a file is read and contoured using
   default values.


   In this example, the same file is read and the header is listed to
   determine the range of the z data (DEPMIN and DEPMAX.) Only
   selected portions of the output from LISTHDR_ are shown.  A range
   of contour levels between 700 km and 1150 km and an increment of 25
   km is selected.  A list of four linestyles is selected, starting
   with a solid line.  The list will be repeated for every four
   contour levels.  A title is defined and the contour plot was
   generated::

      SAC> READ MYDATA
      SAC> LISTHDR
         FILE: MYDATA
              NPTS = 10000
            IFTYPE = GENERAL XYZ (3-D) FILE
            DEPMIN = 697.71
            DEPMAX = 1154.4
            NXSIZE = 100
          XMINIMUM = 82574.
          XMAXIMUM = 86992.
            NYSIZE = 100
          YMINIMUM = 0.47439E+06
          YMAXIMUM = 0.47720E+06
      SAC> ZLEVELS RANGE 700 1150 INCREMENT 25
      SAC> ZLINES LIST 1 2 3 4
      SAC> TITLE 'Katmai topography from survey data [inc = 25 km]'
      SAC> CONTOUR



   The result of this example is shown in the figure below.

   In the final example, the same data is used but different display
   options are selected.  Integer labels are selected for every fourth
   contour level and "down" tick marks are selected for the contour
   levels in between.  Solid linestyles are used for all contour
   levels::

      SAC> READ MYDATA
      SAC> ZLEVELS RANGE 700 1150 INCREMENT 25
      SAC> ZLABELS ON LIST INT OFF OFF OFF
      SAC> ZTICKS ON LIST 0 -1 -1 -1
      SAC> ZLINES LIST 1
      SAC> TITLE 'Katmai topography from survey data [labels and ticks]'
      SAC> CONTOUR

   The result of this example is shown in the figure below.
