CORRELATE
+++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Computes the auto- and cross- correlation functions.

SYNTAX
------
::

  CORRELATE  {MASTER name|n},
      {NUMBER n},{LENGTH ON|OFF|v},
      {TYPE  RECTANGLE|HAMMING|HANNING|COSINE|TRIANGLE}

INPUT
-----
   :MASTER name|n:  Select master file in data file list by name or
       number.  All files will be correlated against this one.

   :NUMBER n:  Set number of correlation windows to be used.

   :NORMALIZED  OFF: No normalization

   :NORMALIZED ON: Results are normalized between -1.0 and 1.0

   :LENGTH {ON}:  Turn fixed window length option on.

   :LENGTH OFF:  Turn fixed window length option off.

   :LENGTH v:  Turn fixed window length option on and change window
       length in seconds to v.

   :TYPE RECTANGLE:  Apply a rectangle function to each window.  This is
       equivalent to applying no function to each window.

   :TYPE HAMMING:  Apply a hamming function to each window.

   :TYPE HANNING:  Apply a hanning function to each window.

   :TYPE COSINE:  Apply a cosine function to each window.

   :TYPE TRIANGLE:  Apply a triangle function to each window.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  An auto-correlation is computed on the signal declared to be the master
  file, and a cross-correlation is calculated between the master file
  and each of the other signals in memory.  This command computes
  correlations as defined by::

      corr(tau) = int ( f(t) g(tau + t) ) dt,

  where f is the master file, g is any from among the signals in memory, and
  int means summation over all times t.  The number of points in the master
  file cannot be greater than the number of points in any other file in
  memory.  
  
  The input for SAC CORRELATE is files f and g.  The output is the 
  auto-correlation for f and the cross-correlation of f with g. The relative 
  times for the two output files is most easily understood by examining the 
  figure below.  in this case,  f is an isosceles triangle of duration 0.08 s 
  starting at t = 0, which is produced by the commands::
  
    SAC> fg triangle npts 9 begin -0.08 delta 0.02
    SAC> cutim -0.04 0.04; ch b 0.0; write triangle.sac
  
  In this example, g is a synthetic waveform with spikes at phase arrival times 
  with amplitudes and polarity appropriate for that phase.  The P arrival is 
  at t = 0. The maximum amplitude for the auto-correlation always at output 
  time tau = 0.  The P arrival  spike has a high correlation with the triangle 
  pulse.  Note that the maximum for the output cross-correlation is at around 
  -0.04 s, the onset time for the triangle auto-correlation.  The commands for 
  CORRELATE for f with g in this case are as follows::
  
    SAC> r triangle.sac synthetic.sac
    SAC> correlate normalized
    SAC> write sac-autoc_triangle.sac sac-cc_triangle-synth.sac 
    SAC> r sac-autoc_triangle.sac 
    SAC> ch kevnm "sac-autoc_triangle" 
    SAC> write over 
    SAC> r sac-cc_triangle-synth.sac 
    SAC> ch kevnm "sac-cc_tri-synth" 
    SAC> write over 
    
  After *correlate normalized*, the filenames and KEVNM remain as they were 
  before.  Shown here is an example as to to label the output files. 

  If N is the number of points in g and M the number of points in f, the
  total number of points in corr is N+M-1.  SAC does the calculation in the
  frequency domain so if N is not a power of 2, it is increased to N2,
  the next power of 2. Both f and g are padded with zeroes to N2 points before
  the forward transforms.   (It is wise to prepare all input files to minimize
  end effects.)

  The windowing features of this command allow one to compute an average
  correlation function over a set of data windows.  The number of windows is
  selectable and there are five standard windowing functions to choose from.
  When this windowing feature is on, a cross-correlation function is computed
  for each window.  This collection of cross-correlation functions is then
  averaged, cut to the same length as the original data file, and replaces
  the data file in memory.  You may also select the length of each window.

  Window overlap is automatically calculated and used whenever the product
  of the requested window length (LENGTH option) and the number of windows
  (NUMBER option) exceeds the number of points in the data file (NPTS).
  By default, this windowing feature is off.

ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES
-------------------
  To calculate the correlation functions using the third file in memory
  as the master file::

      SAC> CORRELATE MASTER 3

  You could also specify the master file by name if this is easier.
  Assume you have two data files that each contain 1000 points of noise.
  To compute the average correlation functions using 10 windows of 100 points
  each (i.e. no overlap) with a hanning function applied to each window::

      SAC> CORRELATE TYPE HANNING NUMBER 10

  To achieve a twenty percent overlap of each window, set the window length to
  the equivalent of 120 data points.  Assuming a sampling interval of 0.025 (40
  samples per second) this would be three seconds as shown below::

      SAC> CORRELATE TYPE HANNING NUMBER 10 LENGTH 3.0
