Search for station by region, identifier, channel and date

SYNTAX
------
::

  STATION {time start end}
      {network ne,tw,or,ks}
      {station stat,ions}
      {location lo,ca,ti,on,00,10,--}
      {channel cha,nne,els,BH?,HHZ,LHE}
      {outfile filename}
      {origin lon lat}
      {id:eventid}
      {radius min_radius max_radius}
      {ph5}
      {region w e s n}
      {level station|channel}
      {epochs on|off}
      {showtimes}
      {verbose}

INPUT
-----
   :Time: Set the start and end times. End times can be set relatively.  See
       `DATA ACCESS`_ for time formats.

   :Region west east south north: Set the geographic bounds of the search region

   :Radial min max: Set the radius limits of the search region.
       See ORIGIN and id:eventid

   :Origin lon lat: Set the origin (Lon, Lat) for a radial search

   :catalog\:eventid: Set the origin and time from an event's origin time
       and location. This can be used with a region search.

   :Network: Set a collection of networks. Accepts lists and wildcards.

   :Station: Set a collection of stations. Accepts lists and wildcards.

   :Location: Set a collection of locations. Accepts lists and wildcards.

   :Channel: Set a collection of channels. Accepts lists and wildcards.

   :Level: Station or Channel, Station level metadata only includes
      Station location, Channel level metadata includes component
      orientation and can be used as input to the METADATA_ command

   :ph5:  Get additional data from the IRIS PH5 Web service. This option
       provides access to active-source data sets and their associated stations
       with high sample rates and time-limited deployments.

   :Epochs: - Off - Combine all stations with the same Network and
              Station, using the first value encountered
            - On - Treat individual time epochs for stations
              separately, This will result in multiple stations with
              the same Network and Station, but with different epochs.
              This option changes how txt/csv output is written, not XML.

   :ShowTimes: Show start and end date-times in the output.

   :Outfile: Save the station search into a file. Files ending in .xml
       are saved as FDSNStationXML documents; those ending in .txt and
       others are saved as "csv" text.  The Epochs option will modify
       how the output appears.

   :Verbose:  Watch the details of the search process

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------
::

   station epochs off

This command gets everything; you have been warned.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Search a collection of stations meeting a set of criteria.

  Searching can be done geographically using a Region or Radial
  search.  For the Radial search the origin location (Lon, Lat) needs
  to be specified using either the Origin option or from an id:eventid.
  See EVENT_ for a discussion of eventid.

  Setting the Time for a search can be done using two times, start and end,
  or using start and a relative offset.

  If you want a particular Network or set of Stations, those can be
  entered directly in list form separated by commas ',' using
  wildcards and negation, see examples below.  Channels are supported
  just as networks and stations.

  Locations are the same as well, but unless you have specific
  knowledge it is best to ignore the Location option, see examples
  below.

  Specifying id:eventid will set the time of the search and the origin
  location for a radial search.  Timing and origin location
  information is obtained from online catalogs.  Non-existant eventid
  will return an error.  This can be useful for getting stations lists
  for specific stations.

EXAMPLES
--------

The station database has intriguing station data. Lets see if there
are stations on the Moon.  The Moon Landing was in 1969 and the
network code is XA, one of many temporary networks::

   SAC> station net XA time 1969-1 +4y
   Net Sta   Lat.     Lon.      Elev.   SiteName
   XA  S12    -3.0400  -23.4200    0.00 ALSEP 12, Oceanus Procellarum, Moon
   XA  S14    -3.6500  -17.4800    0.00 ALSEP 14, Fra Mauro, Moon
   XA  S15    26.0800    3.6600    0.00 ALSEP 15, Hadley Rille, Moon
   XA  S16    -8.9700   15.5100    0.00 ALSEP 16, Descartes, Moon


We would like stations close to the 2004 Sumartran M9 Event. First
lets get the event id::

   SAC> event time 2004-1 +1yr mag 9
   Origin              Lat.   Lon.    Depth  Mag.     Agency EventID
   2004-12-26T00:58:53   3.29   95.98  30.00 9.10 mw  US/official usgs:official20041226005853450_30

Using that eventid we can search for stations nearby::

   SAC> station usgs:official20041226005853450_30 radial 0 5
   Net Sta   Lat.     Lon.      Elev.   SiteName
   PS  PSI     2.6938   98.9237  987.00 Parapat, Indonesia
   SY  GSI     1.3039   97.5755  107.00 GSI synthetic
   SY  LHMI    5.2288   96.9472    3.00 LHMI synthetic
   SY  PSI     2.6938   98.9237  987.00 PSI synthetic

There are stations that are only contain synthetics, Network SY. Lets
get rid of those::

   SAC> station usgs:official20041226005853450_30 radial 0 5 net -SY
   Net Sta   Lat.     Lon.      Elev.   SiteName
   PS  PSI     2.6938   98.9237  987.00 Parapat, Indonesia

Epochs can be confusing as stations are serviced and instruments are
changed, new epochs or time ranges are added. For example IU.ANMO has
been operating since the mid-1990s and has multiple time periods::

   SAC> station net IU sta ANMO epochs on
   Net Sta   Lat.     Lon.      Elev.   SiteName
   IU  ANMO   34.9459 -106.4572 1850.00 Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA

   IU  ANMO   34.9502 -106.4602 1839.00 Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA

   IU  ANMO   34.9459 -106.4572 1820.00 Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA


   SAC> station net IU sta ANMO epochs off

(To fit on the page, the last column *SiteName* is left out.  For all of
them it is *Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA*.)

**PH5 Example**:  Active-source stations are typically not available through the
IRIS Web Service, but can be accessed through the PH5 Web Services.  Station
9A.22770 is one of these stations. To access its information, you need to
specify the PH5 option to tell SAC to also search within PH5::

   SAC> station net 9A station 22770
   Error 404 (HTTP): No Content

   SAC> station net 9A station 22770  PH5
   Net Sta   Lat.     Lon.      Elev.   SiteName
   9A  22770 44.4122 -115.4911 1966.30 Deformation and magmatic modification
