LINE
++++

SUMMARY
-------
Controls the linestyle selection in plots.

SYNTAX
------
::

  LINE {ON|OFF|SOLID|DOTTED|n} {FILL ON|OFF|{POS_COLOR|NEG_COLOR}}
       {INCREMENT {ON|OFF}}, {LIST STANDARD|nlist}

INPUT
-----
   :{ON}:  Turn line-drawing on.  Don't change linestyle.

   :OFF:  Turn line-drawing off.

   :SOLID:  Change to solid linestyle and turn line-drawing on.

   :DOTTED:  Change to dotted linestyle and turn line-drawing on.

   :n:  Change to linestyle n and turn line-drawing on.  A linestyle of 0
       is the same as turning turning line-drawing off.  Figure below shows
       linestyles for n = 1 through 10. SOLID is n = 1, DOTTED is n = 8.

   :INCREMENT {ON}:  For multiple data files in a plot, increment
       linestyle from linestyle list for each data file in the plot.

   :INCREMENT OFF:  Do not increment linestyle for multiple data files.

   :LIST STANDARD:  Change to the standard linestyle list (1 2 3 ..).

   :LIST nlist:  Change the content of the linestyle list.  Enter list of
       linestyle numbers (e.g., 3 1 2 ..).

   :FILL ON/OFF:   Turn filling on/off.

   :FILL POS_COLOR/NEG_COLOR:   Fill color for positive/negative section of
       the seismogram trace.  Turns FILL on.  See COLOR_ for color options.

   :FILL LIST STANDARD:  Use Standard color list for Color Filling.

   :FILL LIST POS_COLOR/NEG_COLOR:  Turn on color filling incrementing
       multiple colors in a list are available to set colors.  Colors are
       specified in either Color Name or Number

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command controls the linestyle used when plotting data.  The
  skeleton (axes, titles, etc.) are always plotted using solid lines.  Grid
  linestyle is controlled by the GRID_ command.

  There are other commands that control other aspects of the data display.
  The SYMBOL_ command can be used to display a set of scalable, centered symbols
  at each data point.  The COLOR_ command controls color selection, and the
  WIDTH_ command controls the line-width.  All of these attributes are
  independent of each other.  You may select a blue dotted line with a symbol at
  each data point if you desire.  A linestyle of 0 is the same as turning
  line drawing off.  This is useful in the LIST option and the SYMBOL_ command
  to display some data with lines and some with symbols on the same plot.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To select an incrementing linestyle using the STANDARD list - starting
  with linestyle 1::

      SAC>  LINE 1 INCREMENT

  To change the linestyle list to contain linestyles 3, 5, and 1::

      SAC>  LINE LIST 3 5 1

  To plot three files on the same plot using PLOT2_ with the first file plotted
  using a solid line and no symbol, the second with no line and a triangle
  symbol, and the third with no line and a cross symbol::

      SAC>  READ FILE1 FILE2 FILE3
      SAC>  LINE LIST 1 0 0 INCREMENT
      SAC>  SYMBOL LIST 0 3 7 INCREMENT
      SAC>  PLOT2

  To fill in the positive ecursions on a seismogram with red and the negtive
  excursions with blue.  If one leaves out the 0, the colored regions would be
  outlined with a black line::

      SAC> fg seismo
      SAC> line 0 fill red/blue
      SAC> p1
