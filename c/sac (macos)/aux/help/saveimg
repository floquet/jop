SAVEIMG
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Saves a display graphics window to an image file in a variety of formats

SYNTAX
------
::

  [SAVE]IMG filename.format

INPUT
-----
   :filename:  Filename for the saved image.

   :format: Format for saved file from among one of the four choices:

       - ps  (Postscript);
       - pdf (Portable Document Format);
       - png (Image file) [No longer included in the binary SAC package]
       - xpm (Pixmap format)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  This command will save a current plot to an image file format including
  Postscript (ps), Portable Document Format (pdf), Image file (png), and
  Pixmap file (xpm).  The format is derived from the filename's extension.

  An advantage of SAVEIMG to producing SGF_ files is that letters and numbers
  in .sgf files are made up of drawn line segments, while those in the .ps
  or .pdf images produced by SAVEIMG use the Postscript feature of producing
  fonts directly.  Also, for many applications, a lower-resolution .png or
  .xpm file is sufficient.  Because of potential problems with portability,
  the PNG format is not enabled in the default builds of SAC.

  The title in a save xxx.pdf is made with a font that is larger than that used
  in a title for p1 or p1 print because in producing the PDF file, a postscript
  font (with higher resolution) is used.

  It is possible to produce plots in .png format if one builds SAC from sources
  (see ${SACHOME}/README}.

  Output .xpm and .png files will have the aspect ratio of the current window.
  (See WINDOW_ for instructions about choosing the size and aspect ratio of
  display windows.)  The .pdf and .ps files produced by SAVEIMG will have a
  fixed aspect ratio of X/Y = 11/8.5 = 1.2941.  To make the output .ps or
  .pdf file look most like a P1 or P2 output it is best to choose a display
  window aspect ratio of 1.2941.

  As with .sgf files, the plots will not have a tight boundingbox.  For .sgf
  files the script ${SACHOME}/bin/sgftoeps.csh will produce an EPS file with a
  tight boundingbox if the program Ghsostscript (gs) is in the path.  Similar
  scripts could be written for the output files from SAVEIMG.

  To save a plot using SAVEIMG, the plot must already be visible.  SAVEIMG will
  not work in the SSS subprocess, but if one enters qs after creating the plot,
  SAVEIMG can then be used for that image.  Also, if a frame has been opened to
  produce multiple panels in a single file, saveimg cannot be used until after
  the ENDFRAME_ command. See ${SACHOME}/aux/macros/demo for scripts with 
  examples.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To save a spectrogram in three different formats::

       SAC> fg seismo
       SAC> spectrogram
       SAC> save spectrogram.ps
       SAC> save spectrogram.xpm
       SAC> save spectrogram.pdf

  The plots at the end of the CONVOLVE_, CORRELATE_, and TUTORIAL_ help file
  have an aspect ratio of 3.78 (because the larger aspect ratio takes less
  vertical space, which is useful if the plot is to be included in a docyment).
  The following commands can be used to produce such a plot file::

       SAC> fg seismo
       SAC> window 3 x .04 .94 y .48 .93 aspect 3.78
       SAC> bw 3
       SAC> p2
       SAC> save seismo.xpm
