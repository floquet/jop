DESCRIPTION
-----------
 Download responses for time-series data in memory or specified using the
 command options.

 Data in Memory.  To download responses for data in memory, the following header
 values must be defined:

   - knetwk (Network)
   - kstnm (Station name)
   - khole (Location identifier)
   - kcmpnm (Component)
   - kzdate/kztime (Absolute time of the data, Optional)

An example of getting the response for XE.DOOR..BHZ in either sacpz or
evalresp::

    SAC> r XE.DOOR..BHZ.M.1994.160.003345.sac
    SAC> response
    Writing data to
    SAC_PZs_XE_DOOR__BHZ_1994-06-09T00:33:45_1994-06-09T01:33:44 [  1.02 KiB]
    SAC> response evalresp
    Writing data to RESP.XE.DOOR..BHZ [ 49.80 KiB]
    SAC>

For specific responses, use the net, sta, loc, and cha options::

    SAC> response resp net BK sta BKS loc * cha BHZ
    Writing data to RESP.BK.BKS..BHZ [ 73.52 KiB]

Time Range: If no time period is specified, then the total duration is
requested.  See `DATA ACCESS`_ for time formats.

Wildcards are possible only in the location and channel command options.

Output file names are in the form of:

    - SAC_PZs_net_sta_loc_cha_time
    - SAC_PZs_net_sta_loc_cha_start_end
    - RESP.net.sta.loc.cha

If any of the parts (net, sta, loc, or cha) are wildcards, they are left
blank in the filename. If the file already exists, a period with a number
is appended to the filename, e.g.:

    - RESP.BK.BKS..BHZ
    - RESP.BK.BKS..BHZ.0
    - RESP.BK.BKS..BHZ.1

The TRANSFER_ command discusses sac POLEZERO files and RESP files and
shows how they are used to instrument-correct a time-series data file.
