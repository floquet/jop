CUTERR
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Controls errors due to bad cut parameters.

SYNTAX
------
::

  CUTERR FATAL|USEBE|FILLZ

INPUT
-----
   :FATAL:  Treat cut errors as fatal.

   :USEBE:  Replace bad start cut with file begin and bad stop cut with
       file end.

   :FILLZ:  Fill with zeros before file begin or after file end to
       account for difference between bad cut and file begin and end.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------
::

  FILLZ for signal stacking subprocess, USEBE for others.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  CUTERR controls error conditions arising from bad CUT_ parameters.  It is
  effectively an option of CUT_, but is used with the following syntax: CUTERR
  {cuterr option} ; CUT {CUT options}.   No action is taken until a subsequent
  READ_ or FUNCGEN_.  If the CUTERR option is FATAL, no data will be entered
  into memory.  Data will be enered into memory for options USEBE or FILLZ with
  results as described above.  The options are not case sensitive.

EXAMPLES
--------
  Command *fg seismo* reads into memory a seismogram::

      SAC> CUT OFF
      SAC> fg seismo
      SAC> lh b, a, e, npts, kztime
      b = 9.459999e+00                        a = 1.046400e+01
      e = 1.945000e+01                     npts = 1000
      kztime = 10:38:14.000

  One gets the same result for *lh* if one precedes the *fg seismo* command with
  either *CUT A -5 E* or *CUTERR USEBE ; CUT A -5 E* because USSEBE is the
  default for CUTERR.  One gets a different result for the option FILLZ::

      SAC> CUTEERR FILLZ ; CUT A -5 E
      SAC> fg seismo
      SAC> lh b, a, e, npts, kztime
      b = 5.459999e+00                       a = 1.046400e+01
      e = 1.945000e+01                     npts = 1400
      kztime = 10:38:14.000

  If on followed the CUTERR FILLZ example with *P1*, one would see an abrupt
  transition at time *B* because seismo has a nonzero offset at *B*.  The
  following  set of commands would produce a display with no offset: fg seismo ;
  rtr ; taper ; write test.sac ; CUTEERR FILLZ ; CUT A -5 E ; read test.sac.
