WRITEHDR
++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Overwrites the headers on disk with those in memory.

SYNTAX
------
::

  WRITEHDR

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The data on disk is NOT overwritten by this command.  Use the WRITE_ OVER
  command to overwrite headers and data.  The WRITEHDR_ command should NEVER be
  used if the CUT_ option is on.  The header in memory is modified to reflect
  the effects of the CUT_, but the data on disk is not modified.
  Use of the WRITEHDR_ command on cut data files will have the effect
  of apparently shifting and truncating the data on disk in time.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.

HEADER CHANGES
--------------
  Updates headers on disk.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
  See description above about use of CUT_ and WRITEHDR_.
