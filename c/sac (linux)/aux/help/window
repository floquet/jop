WINDOW
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Sets the location, size, and aspect ratio of graphics windows.

SYNTAX
------
::

  WINDOW n {XSIZE xwmin xwmax} {YSIZE ywmin ywmax}
       {ASPECT [ value | ON | OFF ]}

INPUT
-----
   :n:  The graphics window number of interest.  There are a total of nine
       possible graphics windows [ 1 -  9 ].

   :X xwmin xwmax:  Set the x (horizontal) location of graphics window n
       on the screen.  xwmin is the location of the left edge of the window
       and xwmax is the location of the right edge.  The range of these
       screen coordinates is 0.0 to 1.0.  xsize = xwmax - xwmin.

   :Y ywmin ywmax:  Set the y (vertical) location of graphics window n on
       the screen.  ywmin is the location of the bottom edge of the window
       and ywmax is the location of the top edge.  The range of these
       screen coordinates is 0.0 to 1.0. ysize = ywmax - ywmin.

   :ASPECT VALUE:  If ASPECT is ON (OFF is default), xwmax is not used and the
       xsize is set so that the aspect ratio (xsize/ysize) on the screen for the
       window is VALUE if given or the default if not explicitly given.
       The default for VALUE is 11.0/8.5 = 1.294.

DEFAULT SETTINGS
----------------

       = ===== ===== ===== =====
       n xwmin xwmax ywmin ywmax
       = ===== ===== ===== =====
       1 0.05  0.65  0.45  0.95
       2 0.07  0.67  0.43  0.93
       3 0.09  0.69  0.41  0.91
       4 0.11  0.71  0.39  0.89
       5 0.13  0.73  0.37  0.87
       = ===== ===== ===== =====

The default is n = 1.

For versions 101.5 through 101.6a, the default for ASPECT was ON, so xwmax
was not used in the default windows.  If you prefer the 2011 - 2018  windows,
use a init.m macro (see ${SACHOME}/README) with the following lines::

      window 1 x 0.05 0.65 y 0.45 0.95 aspect on
      window 2 x 0.07 0.67 y 0.43 0.93 aspect on
      window 3 x 0.09 0.69 y 0.41 0.91 aspect on
      window 4 x 0.11 0.71 y 0.39 0.89 aspect on
      window 5 x 0.13 0.73 y 0.37 0.87 aspect on

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The default window set is useful if one wants to create and compare several
  plots in a single SAC session.  For an example about how to produce a screen
  with several separate but related plots, see ${SACHOME}/aux/macros/demo.

  The BEGINWINDOW_ command lets you select the window in which to display
  subsequent plots.  BEGINWINDOW will create the requested window -- erasing its
  contents, if it already existed.  If one wants to change a setting from the
  default setting, the WINDOW command must be called BEFORE a call to
  BEGINWINDOW.  On most systems the user can also move and resize these windows
  dynamically using the mouse and pop-up menus.  Generally but not always, the
  moving of a window will result in the current plot being redraw automatically,
  whereas the resizing of a window results in the current plot being
  redrawn but not rescaled.  The next plot in a resized window will be scaled
  correctly.

  If ASPECT is OFF, the aspect ratio of the displayed window depends on the
  aspect ratio of the screen.  Older terminals typically had an x:y aspect ratio
  of 4:3; newer ones are more varied, but many have an aspect ratio of 16:10 or
  16:9.

  SAVEIMG_ has instructions how to create plot files from displayed windows,
  but for PDF or PS plots,the aspect ratio is fixed to 11.0/8.5 (1.294).
  To get the best resolution for such plots, it is best to have the window
  aspect ration at or near 1.294.

  For screens with large aspect ratios, width/height > 2.0 or < 0.5, e.g.
  multiple monitors and high-end displays and if ASPECT is OFF, the APSECT ratio
  will automatically be turned ON and set to 11/8.5 = 1.294.  This behavior
  attempts to avoid ultra-wide display windows.

  Prior to 2011 (when ASPECT was introduced), the most recent revision to WINDOW
  was in 1986, and computer monitors have evolved considerably since then.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To see the current window values:

      SAC> report window

  To change from the default (n = 1) to give more space at the left of the
  screen::

      SAC> window 1 x 0.25 0.85
      SAC> beginwindow 1

  The y limits will be unchanged.

  Note that the order matters::

      SAC> window 1 ASPECT 1.33 x 0.25 0.85
      SAC> bw 1

  will not give the same answer as  ::

      SAC> window 1 x 0.25 0.85 ASPECT (4.0 / 3.0)
      SAC> bw 1

  which ignores xwmax and fixes the aspect ratio to 4/3 = 1.33 because later
  items on the command line take precedence
