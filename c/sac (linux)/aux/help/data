INPUT
-----
   :avail | download: Display the Availability or Download data

   :catalog\:event_id: Use an eventid to set the origin and start time. Catalogs
      may be usgs, isc, or gcmt. Use the EVENT_ command to get eventids

   :duration: Set the end time using a duration

   :region: Set the region to request stations within: west east south north

   :origin: Set the origin location: lon lat

   :radial: Set the radius limits in degrees: min_radius max_radius

   :time: Set the start and end times. End times can be set relatively

   :network: Set a collection of networks. Accepts lists and wildcards.

   :station: Set a collection of stations. Accepts lists and wildcards.

   :location: Set a collection of locations. Accepts lists and wildcards.

   :channel: Set a collection of channels. Accepts lists and wildcards.

   :in: Input station file for building the data request
       File format is space delimited with Network and Station in the
       1st and 2nd columns. This file can be obtained from STATION_.

   :out: Output request file for saving the data request to run later

   :prefix: Prefix for miniSEED data files

   :ph5:  Get additional data from the IRIS PH5 Web service. This option
       provides access to active-source data sets and their associated stations
       with high sample rates and time-limited deployments.


   :sac: Convert the miniSEED data into sac files and save.  Station meta
      data is obtained for the stations. If an event is specified, event
      meta data is also used

   :mseed: (or miniSEED) Save the miniSEED files

   :read: Read the data following conversion from miniSEED to sac

   :more: Append to data existing data files in memory

   :max: Set the data download size for request: size_in_MB

   :verbose:  Watch the details of the data search / download process

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Search for available data and possibly download the data.  Data will be
  downloaded from multiple data repositories based on where the data
  is held.  Requests are also limited in size, see *max size_in_MB*, to
  allow downloading data in reasonable sizes.

  Time ranges can be set using a variety of formats, see examples
  below. End times can be set using a relative value with units.  See `Data
  Access`_ for time formats.

  EventID from EVENT_ can be used to identify origin times and
  locations.  They will also be used to set sac file meta data for an
  event.

  MiniSEED filenames will be defined when the request was made and
  the data center to which the request was made. Use *prefix* to set
  the starting portion of miniSEED files.

EXAMPLES
--------

Let's get some data from station HELL, channels BHZ, from 2013/05/21 for a single hour::

  SAC> data sta HELL cha BHZ net * loc * time 2013/05/21 +1h

  ## REQUEST 1/ 1
  DATACENTER=NCEDC,http://www.ncedc.org
  BK HELL 00 BHZ 2013-05-21T00:00:00 2013-05-21T01:00:00

  No Data Downloaded, use miniSEED, sac, or read to download data

Note that the request is displayed to the screen but the data
was not download.  If you desire a saved, fuller version of the
request, use the *out* option to save the request.  If you want the
data, run the same command again with

  - *miniSEED* option to download miniSEED data
  - *sac* option to get sac data
  - *read* to place the data into memory

These options can be used individually or together. You can download data into
SAC files and place those files into memory using the *sac* and *read* options
together. For now, let's just get miniSEED data by appending the the *miniSEED*
option::

  SAC> data sta HELL cha BHZ net * loc * time 2013/05/21 +1h miniSEED
  Data Center: NCEDC,http://www.ncedc.org
          Writing data to fdsnws.2019.07.12.10.38.15.NCEDC.mseed [276.00 KiB]

The data is written to a file with the prefix *fdsn*, the time of the request,
the data center which provided the data, and a *mseed* extension.  Note, the
time in the file name has no relation to the data within the file.

Alternatively, if the request was saved to a file called *request.txt* the
data can be obtained using::

  SAC> data request request.txt
  Data Center: NCEDC,http://www.ncedc.org
          Writing data to fdsnws.2019.07.12.10.40.22.NCEDC.mseed [276.00 KiB]

Another option is to obtain data for a specific event using the duration
and channel options.  First we need an event::

  SAC> event time 2019-05-14 +1d mag 7 cmt
  Origin              Lat.   Lon.    Depth  Mag.     Agency EventID
  2019-05-14T12:58:41  -3.96  152.53  18.80 7.60 MW  GCMT/- GCMT gcmt:11037207

We can then use the eventid at the end of the line to request data::

  SAC> data gcmt:11037207 dur +10m net IU sta * cha BHZ rad 35 45 miniSEED
  Data Center: IRISDMC,http://ds.iris.edu
  Writing data to fdsnws.2019.07.12.10.53.30.IRISDMC.mseed [584.00 KiB]

An input station file using the *IN* keyword can also be used to request data::

     SAC> station net YE sta SPOLE cha BHZ level station out southpole.txt
     Net Sta   Lat.     Lon.      Elev.   SiteName
     YE  SPOLE -89.9300  144.4400 2850.00 South Pole, Antarctica

     SAC> data time 2014/03/01 +10m cha BHZ in southpole.txt miniSEED
     Reading station file: southpole.txt
     Data Center: IRISDMC,http://ds.iris.edu
             Writing data to fdsnws.2019.10.30.19.31.34.IRISDMC.mseed [ 22.00 KiB]

It can be useful to see what may be download first; particularly if you forget
to specify your desired channels and mistakenly download 10s of channels you are
not interested in.

Large downloads will be divided into smaller chunks. The
resulting miniSEED files will be merged back together during reading,
provided gaps do not exist::

  SAC> data net II sta BORG loc 00 cha BHZ time 2015/03/15 +1mo max 200

  ## REQUEST 1/ 3
  DATACENTER=IRISDMC,http://ds.iris.edu
  II BORG 00 BHZ 2015-03-15T00:00:00.000 2015-03-25T08:00:00.000

  ## REQUEST 2/ 3
  DATACENTER=IRISDMC,http://ds.iris.edu
  II BORG 00 BHZ 2015-03-25T08:00:00.000 2015-04-04T16:00:00.000

  ## REQUEST 3/ 3
  DATACENTER=IRISDMC,http://ds.iris.edu
  II BORG 00 BHZ 2015-04-04T16:00:00.000 2015-04-15T00:00:00.000

  No Data Downloaded, use miniSEED, sac, or read to download data

Request files are written when requested using the *out* option or
when data is requested/downloaded.  The format of the request file starts with
the request parameters followed by the individual data center
requests.  Lines starting with *#* are comments.

The request file is rewritten as indivdual requests are made allowing
for larger requests to be stopped and restarted.

**PH5 Example**:  If data originates from the PH5 Web service and metadata is
desired in a resulting sac file, the PH5 option must be provided to tell sac to
also search this repository for station metadata.  The first example is able to
download data, but results in an error when getting data.  Adding the PH5 option
in the second example below, allows the metadata to be obtained and added to the data::
