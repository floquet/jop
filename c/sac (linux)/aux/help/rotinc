ROTINC
++++++

SUMMARY
-------

Rotate a set of 3 perpendicular components either around the vertical (V) direction
(TO VRT or TO VNE) or around the Transverse (T) direction (TO LQT)

SYNTAX
------

Rotations around the vertical (cmpinc = 0 degrees) direction::

  ROTINC {TO VRT|VNE}

Rotations around the transverse (cmpaz = baz-90) direction::

  ROTINC {TO LQT} {ANGLE angle}

or::

  ROTINC {TO LQT} {iP | iS} {vP alpha} {vS beta} {RAY p} {VERBOSE}


INPUT
-----
  :TO VRT: rotate into vertical,radial, transverse coordinate system

  :TO VNE: rotate into system aligned with vertical, north, and east

  :TO LQT: rotate into P, SV, and SH coordinate system

  :ANGLE a: Rotation through an angle a (V to L)  around T.  L cmpinc = a

  :iP: incident P wave: calculated L cmpinc is the incident P apparent angle

  :iS: Incident S wave: calculated Q cmpinc is the incident SV apparent angle

  :vP v: v is P-wave velocity at the surface (default 5.8)

  :vS v: v is S-wave velocity at the surface (default 3.36)

  :RAY p: ray parameter, p in sec/km (no default value, so must be set)

  :VERBOSE: prints information to the screen for iP or iS options (default off)

DESCRIPTION
-----------

  Given three perpendicular components of a recorded time series, ROTINC
  rotates the set into the selected coordinate system. It works its way
  through all records in memory until it fails to find three consecutive
  perpendicular traces. It assumes vertical up (cmpinc = 0.0), cmpaz
  measured clockwise from N.  T to the right from the vertical-radial
  plane facing towards the station (baz - 90).  Hence, VNE, VRT, and LQT are
  all left-handed coordinate systems.

  For TO LQT, the "TO LQT" can be left out because that is the only option for which
  there are additional arguments.  For TO LQT, there are two choices:

     1 ROTINC ANGLE a: rotation around the T axis (a=0.0 is up)

     2.ROTINC iP or ROTINC iS: rotation around T, through a calculated angle that is
     calculated assuming the P or SV wave is incident on the free surface (top of
     a half space).  For iP, the output cmpinc for L is often called the apparent angle:
     the arctangent of the radial (R) amplitude  divided by the vertical (V) amplitude.
     For iS, the output cmpinc for Q is the incident SV apparent angle. For ROTINC iS, the
     incident SV angle must be less than the critical angle: vP * RAY < 1.0.

EXAMPLES
--------

Rotations around the vertical are straightforward: either TO VNE or TO VRT with no
arguments.

Here are examples for TO LQT.  For a rotation around T through an angle 24.44::

  SAC> ROTINC ANGLE 24.44 (or ROTINC TO LQT ANGLE 24.44)
     Input: rotation angle from V to L

For a free-surface correction (Note: one must specify RAY.)  Here
p = sin(21.32)/5.8) = 0.063, where 21.32 is the P incident angle::

  SAC> ROTINC iP RAY 0.063 VERBOSE
    Incident P wave; free-surface response
    vP: 5.80 km/s vS: 3.36 km/s Ray Param: 0.063000 s/km
    Apparent angle: 24.44
  SAC> message &1,cmpinc &1,kcmpnm
    24.4416
    L

Generally vP and vS are the velocities in the surface layer.  If the wavelength of the
dominant arrivals are larger than the thickness of that layer, one may have to average
over two or more layers.  This can be tested by plotting the vertical-radial particle
motion (PLOTPM_) as the output motion is along the apparent angle.  The ray parameter
will not be changed.  Here is an example for the same ray but assuming the wavelengths
are long enough to average over the whole crust::

  SAC> ROTINC iP vp 8.04 vs 4.47 RAY 0.063 VERBOSE
    Incident P wave; free-surface response
    vP: 8.04 km/s vS: 4.47 km/s Ray Param: 0.063000 s/km
    Apparent angle: 32.71

Here is an example for iS (p = sin(23.12)/3.36) = 0.1169, where 23.12 is the SV
incident angle::

  SAC> ROTINC iS RAY 0.1169 VERBOSE
     Incident S wave; free surface response
     vP: 5.80 km/s vS: 3.36 km/s Ray Param: 0.116900 s/km
     Apparent angle: 115.82
  SAC> message &2,cmpinc &2,kcmpnm
    115.817
    Q

There is often interference with other arrivals for SV on the vertical, so the
SV on V and R are generally not that similar.  Hence V-R particle motion is less
useful for SV than it is for P.

EQUATIONS
---------

The relevant cmpinc (apparent angle) is computed using the following equations:

  * iP:: 

     L cmpinc = atan(2*Vs*p*sqrt(1-(Vs*p)**2)/(1-2*(Vs*p)**2) )

  * iS::

     Q cmpinc = atan(Vp*(1-2*(Vs*p)**2))/(2*Vs**2*p*sqrt(1-(Vp*p)**2)) )

where p is the ray parameter. Equations are based on Problem 5.6 in
Aki and Richards, 2002, pg. 184.
