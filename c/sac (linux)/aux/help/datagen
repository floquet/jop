DATAGEN
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Generates sample data files and stores them in memory.

SYNTAX
------
::

  DATAGEN {MORE} {COMMIT|ROLLBACK|RECALLTRACE} {SUB name} {filelist}

where SUB is a datagen subdirectory and "name" is one of the following::

  LOCAL
  REGIONAL
  TELESEISEM
  DEEP

INPUT
-----
   :MORE:  Place the new sample data files in memory AFTER the old data.
       If this option is omitted, the new sample data files REPLACE the
       old ones.

   :Note:  if the MORE option is not specified, the COMMIT_, ROLLBACK_,
       and RECALLTRACE_ options have no effect.

   :COMMIT:  If the MORE option is specified, the COMMIT option commits
       headers and waveforms in SAC memory -- removing any previous
       versions of headers or waveforms from RAM -- prior to
       generating more files.  COMMIT is the default.

   :ROLLBACK:  If the MORE option is specified, the ROLLBACK option reverts
       to the last committed version of the header and waveform
       before generating more files.

   :RECALLTRACE:  If the MORE option is specified, the RECALLTRACE option:

      - reverts to the last committed version of the waveform,
      - reverts to the last committed version of those header
        variables closely linked to the waveform,
      - commits those header variables which are loosely linked
        to the waveform.
        (use HELP_ RECALLTRACE for a list of which header variables are
        committed, and which are rolled back.)

   :SUB name: Select the sub-directory name from which to read the data.
       Where the subdirectory name is local, regional, or teleseismic.

       A filelist is required. Possible filenames are listed below.

   :name: LOCAL | REGIONAL | TELESEIS | DEEP: Specifics about the
       contents of these sub-directories is given below.

   :filelist:  Each SUBdirectory has SAC files from a single event. A *filelist*
       is one or more SAC files in SUB.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  The DATAGUEN command operates much like the READ_ command except that for
  DATAGEN, any SAC file read into memory is from a subdirectory of
  ${SACHOME}/aux/datagen/SUB/. Help file TRAVELTIME_ includes runs that use
  DATAGEN.

LOCAL EVENT
-----------
  The local event occurred in the Livermore Valley of California.
  It was a small unfelt event (ML 1.6).  It was recorded by the Livermore Local
  Seismic Network (LLSN).  LLSN is a set of vertical and three-component
  stations operated by LLNL and the USGS.  Data from nine three-component
  stations are included in this set.  There is 40 seconds of data sampled at 100
  samples per second.  Station information, event information, p-wave
  time picks, and coda picks are included in the headers.  The filenames are::

    cal.z, cal.n, cal.e
    cao.z, cao.n, cao.e
    cda.z, cda.n, cda.e
    cdv.z, cdv.n, cdv.e
    cmn.z, cmn.n, cmn.e
    cps.z, cps.n, cps.e
    cva.z, cva.n, cva.e
    cvl.z, cvl.n, cvl.e
    cvy.z, cvy.n, cvy.e

REGIONAL EVENT
--------------
  The regional event occurred in Nevada and was recorded by the
  Digital Seismic Network (DSS).  DSS is a set of four broadband
  three-component stations in the Western U.S.  The stations are:

   :elk: Elko, NV
   :lac: Landers, CA
   :knb: Kanab, UT
   :mnv: Mina, NV

  The sampling rate is 40 samples per second. The files contain 300 seconds of
  data, starting 5 seconds before the origin time of the event.  The filenames
  are::

    elk.z, elk.n, elk.e
    lac.z, lac.n, lac.e
    knb.z, knb.n, knb.e
    mnv.z, mnv.n, mnv.e


TELESEISMIC EVENT
-----------------
  The teleseismic event occurred off the coast of Northern
  California near Eureka on September 10, 1984.  It was a moderate to large
  event (ML 6.6, MB 6.1, MS 6.7) and was felt from the San Francisco Bay area
  to Roseburg, Oregon.  It was recorded at the Regional Seismic Test Network
  (RSTN), a set of five stations in the U.S. and Canada.  The stations are:

    :cpk: Tennessee
    :ntk: Northwest Territories, Canada
    :nyk: New York
    :onk: Ontario, Canada
    :sdk: South Dakota

  Both mid-period and long period data is included.  Data from cpk was not
  available and the long-period data from sdk is clipped.  There is 1600 seconds
  of data in this set.  The long-period data was recorded at 1 sample per second
  and the mid-period data at 4 samples per second::

    ntkl.z, ntkl.n, ntkl.e, ntkm.z, ntkm.n, ntkm.e
    nykl.z, nykl.n, nykl.e, nykm.z, nykm.n, nykm.e
    onkl.z, onkl.n, onkl.e, onkm.z, onkm.n, onkm.e
    sdkl.z, sdkl.n, sdkl.e, sdkm.z, sdkm.n, sdkm.e


DEEP EVENT
----------
  (New in SAC v102.0)  The seismograms in DEEP are from the Sakhalin
  Island Event (May 12, 1990; M=6.5; Depth=611 km). The phases are
  very impulsive, and one can see many converted phases. There are
  vertical-, radial-, and transverse-component waveforms from eight
  broadband stations.  The filenames are::

   bla.r bla.t bla.z
   ccm.r ccm.t ccm.z
   cor.r cor.t cor.z
   hrv.r hrv.t hrv.z
   kev.r kev.t kev.z
   kip.r kip.t kip.z
   pas.r pas.t pas.z
   tol.r tol.t tol.z

  This data set was created as part of a focal-mechanism study, which used the
  polarity and amplitudes of the *SV* and *SH* phases.  Horizontal components
  for a three-component seismograph must be rotated from *North-South* and
  *East-West* into *Radial* and *Transvers* to separate *SV* from *SH*.
  Positive *Radial* is forward, and positive *Transverse* is to the right with
  respect to an observer facing the station on the epicenter-station line.  To
  verify this::

    SAC> datagen sub deep kev.*
      /usr/local/sac/aux/datagen/deep/kev.r ...kev.t ...kev.z
    SAC> lh baz cmpaz
      FILE: /usr/local/sac/aux/datagen/deep/kev.r - 1
      baz = 4.882252e+01                    cmpaz = 2.288225e+02
      FILE: /usr/local/sac/aux/datagen/deep/kev.t - 2
      baz = 4.882252e+01                    cmpaz = 3.188225e+02
      FILE: /usr/local/sac/aux/datagen/deep/kev.z - 3
      baz = 4.882252e+01                    cmpaz = 0.000000e+00
    SAC>

  For the *Radial* direction, the cmpaz is in the opposition direction of the
  back azimuth, and, as discussed in ROTATE_, the *Transverse* is 90 degrees
  more than the *Radial*.

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.

  - haven't given a list of files to read.
  - none of the files in the list could be read.

- 1314: Data file list can't begin with a number.
- 1315: Maximum number of files in data file list is


WARNING MESSAGES
----------------
- 0101: opening file
- 0108: File does not exist:
- 0114: reading file

  - Normally when SAC encounters one of these errors it skips that file and
    reads the remainder.  These errors can be made to be fatal using
    the READERR_ command.
