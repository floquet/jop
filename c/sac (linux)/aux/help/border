DESCRIPTION
-----------
   When this option is on, a solid border is drawn around the sides of the plot
   at the edge of the viewport (see XVPORT_) Note that an axis line is always
   drawn on each side of the plot that contains an annotated axis (see AXES_) or
   a set of tick marks (see TICKS_).  Thus the border option only applies to those
   sides without axes or tick marks.
