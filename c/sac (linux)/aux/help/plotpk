PLOTPK
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Produces a plot for the picking of arrival times.

SYNTAX
------
::

  PLOTPK options

where options are one or more of the following::

  {PERPLOT {ON|OFF|n}},
  {BELL {ON|OFF}},
  {ABSOLUTE|RELATIVE},
  {REFERENCE {ON|OFF|v}},
  {MARKALL {ON|OFF}},
  {SAVELOCS {ON|OFF}}


INPUT
-----
   :PERPLOT n:  Plots n files per frame.

   :PERPLOT ON:  Plots n files per frame.  Use last value for n.

   :PERPLOT OFF:  Plots all files on one frame.

   :BELL OFF:  keystrokes are silent.

   :BELL ON:  Rings bell on each keystroke in active window.

   :ABSOLUTE:  Plot files treating time as an absolute.  Files with
       different begin times will be shifted relative to each other.

   :RELATIVE:  Plot files relative to that file's begin time.

   :GMT:  Display pick times in absolute (GMT) format.

   :ZERO:  Display pick times relative to each files's zero time.

   :REFERENCE v:  Turn reference line display on and change reference
       value to v.

   :REFERENCE ON:  Turn reference line display on using last value of v.

   :REFERENCE OFF:  Turn reference line display off.

   :MARKALL ON:  Store header picks in all of the files displayed on a
       particular plot.

   :MARKALL OFF:  Store header pick only in the file marked by the
       horizontal cursor.

   :SAVELOCS OFF:  Do not save pick locations in the blackboard.

   :SAVELOCS ON:  Save pick locations (from l cursor command) to
       blackboard variables.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The format of the PLOTPK plot is similiar to the PLOT1_ plot.  When the
   crosshairs comes on, you position the crosshair center at a point on the
   displayed waveform and enter single-character keystrokes to perform various
   functions. Some but not all keystrokes produce graphic output on the screen.
   Error and output messages are printed at the top of the plot window.  Mouse
   clicks will identify the time and amplitude of the cursor position. A mouse
   drag will initiate a zoom operation.

   If one tries to resize the plot window during PPK, SAC exits with an error
   message. Plot window resizing must be done before entering PPK.

   Picks that are currently in the header are automatically displayed on
   the screen as vertical lines at the pick time with labels.  Output from some
   keystrokes can be directed to the SAC header, to an alphanumeric file, or a
   hypo pick file if open (see OAPF_ and OHPF_).  If REFERENCE is on with a
   value v, if z is typed, there will be a "zero-level" horizontal line drawn at
   the cursor's vertical position plus two additional horizontal lines at +/- v.

   If option SAVELOCS is on, cursor locations from the L cursor option are
   saved to blackboard variables as follows:

   :NLOCS: The number of locations picked during the execution of this command.
           This is initialized to 0 each time PLOTPK is invoked and incremented
           by 1 each time a cursor location pick is made.

   :XLOCn: The x value for the nth cursor location pick.  This will be the GMT
       time of the pick if the reference time fields in the header are
       defined. Otherwise, this will be an offset time.

   :YLOCn: The y value for the nth cursor location pick.

   The command PLOTPKTABLE_ lists valid cursor options for plotpk.

EXAMPLE
-------

The following example starts by opening an alphanumeric pick file, reads in a
time-series file UOM1.Z (that is in directory doc/examples/),and calls ppk.
In ppk I first expand the window to fill the screen, then it picks the P arrival
and the P amplitude and then the S arrival time and amplitude.  After
exiting ppk, I display the picks from the header and the bb variables.  I
close the APF file and display its contents::

      SAC> oapf name
      SAC> r UOM1.Z
      SAC> ppk
         ** Description                Key (case-insensitive)
         ** Zoom in to the P arrival:  x then x (or click and drag)
         ** Pick P arrival time:       i u 0 p  (Impulsive, Up, Quality 0, P arrival)
         ** Pick P amplitude:          l
         ** Expand view:               o
         ** Zoom in to the S arrival:  x then x (or click and drag)
         ** Pick S arrival time:       i u 1 s  (Impulsive, Up, Quality 1, S arrival)
         ** Pick S amplitude:          l
         ** Quit PPK:                  q

The P pick is stored in header variable A, and the (IPU) in KA.  The S pick
is stored in T0 with  (ISD1) in KT0.
