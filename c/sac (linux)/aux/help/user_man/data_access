OVERVIEW
--------
Starting in version 102.0, SAC is capable of viewing and downloading event,
station, and response metadata and downloading waveforms from online
Web services. These abilities include

    - event searches ( EVENT_ )
    - station searches ( STATION_ )
    - data: searches and downloading ( DATA_ )
    - applying station and/or event meta-data to data ( METADATA_ )
    - reading miniseed directly into SAC ( READ_ )
    - download instrument responses ( RESPONSE_ )
    - traveltime data using the the IRIS Traveltime Web Service ( TRAVELTIME_ )

**Definitions**

  Currently (2020), as described on the IRIS DMC Web Service Web page
   <https://service.iris.edu>:

     - **miniSEED** is the subset of the SEED standard that is used for time
       series  data. Very limited metadata for the time series is included in
       miniSEED beyond time series identification and simple state-of-health
       flags. In particular, geographic coordinates, response/scaling
       information and other information needed to interpret the data values are
       not included.

     - **FDSN StationXML**  is the XML-based standard for seismological
       metadata.  These metadata contain the most important and commonly used
       structures of SEED 2.4 metadata with many enhancements.

     - **PH5** is the name of the repository at the IRIS DMC commonly used for
       active-source, controlled-source and mixed-source data sets and is an
       alternative to the DMC's SEED repository.  In DATA_, METADATA_, and
       STATION_ ph5 is an option that when invoked will search this alternate
       repository.

Web requests are made to the colletion of Web Services at
`<http://service.iris.edu>`_ along with event searches through the
`USGS <http://earthquake.usgs.gov>`_ and `ISC <http://www.isc.ac.uk>`_.

An **EventID** is defined by *source:uniqueid*. See EVENT_ for more details.

Event search results, EVENT_, can be used as input for timing and
location in DATA_ and STATION_ searches using assocaited *EventID*. Examples are
given below.

The format for latitudes and longitudes is degrees.decimal-degrees.  Longitudes
run from -180.00 degrees to 180.00 degrees.  The formats used for time are given
at the end of this file.

For repeated calls to most SAC command in a single session, the program
"remembers" previous values for options if not reset explicitly.  That
is **not** true for these commands; For any option not explicitly stated in each
call, the default is assumed.  If there is no default value for an option, it
must be explicitly given.

The SAC convention for units differs from others such as EVALRESP and SEED
that use SI units (meters, meters/sec, meters/sec/sec).  SAC uses nm for
displacement.  As discussed in TRANSFER_, unit conversions may be needed to
convert output files from instrument-corrections to get consistency between the
data and the SAC header parameter IDEP.

**SACLST & SACSET**: These two stand-alone programs allow one to parse
(*saclst*) or modify the header or of one or more SAC files.  They are
analogous to the internal SAC commands LISTHDR_ and READHDR_
respectively. One can display the results on the screen, print them,
or (for *saclst*) redirect the output into an application.  See
${SACHOME}/utils/README_utils for more details.  Examples are given
below showing how *saclst* output can be redirected to applications.

TIME FORMATS
------------
Times are of the form *h:m:s* or *h:m:s.ms* where *h* is the hour, *m*
the minute, *s* the seconds, and *ms* the millisecodnds. If the time
is left out, the beginning of the day is used, i.e. *00:00:00.000*.

Dates are in the form *Y-M-D* or *Y-O* where *Y* is the year, *M* the
month, *D* the day of the month, and *O* the day of the year (or
ordinal day). Separators for the date components include */*, *,*, and
*-*.  Separators between the date and time is either a *T* or the date
separator.

EVENT SEARCH
------------

**Broad search**

Let's find all M :math:`\ge` 9 earthquakes within the past
century (100 years), assuming the date today is Oct-31-2019.  This
will search the USGS Earthquake catalog by default::

     SAC> event time 2019-10-31 -100years mag 9
     Origin              Lat.   Lon.    Depth  Mag.     Agency EventID
     2011-03-11T05:46:24  38.30  142.37  29.00 9.10 mww US/official -
        usgs:official20110311054624120_30
     2004-12-26T00:58:53   3.29   95.98  30.00 9.10 mw  US/official -
        usgs:official20041226005853450_30

        usgs:official19640328033616_30
     1960-05-22T19:11:20 -38.14  -73.41  25.00 9.50 mw  iscgem/official -

        usgs:official19521104165830_30

**Using the NOW keyword**

Using the *NOW* keyword in place of the first date is useful in scripts so one
does not have to explicitly enter today's date.  Let's use *NOW* and also change
the catalog to Global CMT::

     SAC> event time now -100years mag 9 gcmt
     Origin              Lat.   Lon.    Depth  Mag.     Agency EventID
     2011-03-11T05:47:32  37.52  143.05  20.00 9.10 MW  GCMT/- GCMT gcmt:3279407
     2004-12-26T01:01:09   3.09   94.26  28.60 9.00 MW  GCMT/- GCMT gcmt:1916079

Note that the results from Global CMT, compared to the USGS, do not
have the older events and the prefix for the event id is also
different.

**Narrow search**

If we are interested in a particular event, an event time window, or
depth range, that can be specified directly::

     SAC> event time 1994/1 1994/365 mag 8 depth 600 1000 usgs
     Origin              Lat.   Lon.    Depth  Mag.     Agency EventID
     1994-06-09T00:33:16 -13.84  -67.55 631.30 8.20 mw  US/HRV - usgs:usp0006dzc

STATION SEARCH
--------------

**Rectangular Search in a Network**

Looking for available stations is straightforward by using a region,
network name, station name and channels.  Here we only use a small
region and the network *IU*::

     SAC> station region -130 -110 45 48 net IU
     Warning: Multiple instances of net.sta, likely mutiple epochs
     Net Sta   Lat.     Lon.      Elev.   SiteName
     IU  RAIO   46.0403 -122.8851    1.00 Rainier, Oregon, USA

**Radial Search with a time window in a Network**

If a particular time range or distance range is of interest, that may
be specified as well::

     SAC> station network IU channel ?HZ time 2011-03-11 1day radial 30 35
          origin 143.05 37.53
     Net Sta   Lat.     Lon.      Elev.   SiteName
     IU  ADK    51.8823 -176.6842  130.00 Adak, Aleutian Islands, Alaska
     IU  BILL   68.0653  166.4531  320.00 Bilibino, Russia
     IU  DAV     7.0697  125.5791  150.00 Davao, Philippines
     IU  MIDW   28.2156 -177.3698   20.00 Midway Island, USA
     IU  TIXI   71.6341  128.8667   40.00 Tiksi, Russia

**Using an EventID**

The previous search was for stations operating during the 2011 Tohoku
event with an epicentral distance 30 and 35 degrees. This search can
be simplified by using and event id::

     SAC> event mag 9 time 2011/1 +1y gcmt
     Origin              Lat.   Lon.    Depth  Mag.     Agency EventID
     2011-03-11T05:47:32  37.52  143.05  20.00 9.10 MW  GCMT/- GCMT gcmt:3279407

     SAC> station net IU cha ?HZ gcmt:3279407 radial 30 35
     Net Sta   Lat.     Lon.      Elev.   SiteName
     IU  ADK    51.8823 -176.6842  130.00 Adak, Aleutian Islands, Alaska
     IU  BILL   68.0653  166.4531  320.00 Bilibino, Russia
     IU  DAV     7.0697  125.5791  150.00 Davao, Philippines
     IU  MIDW   28.2156 -177.3698   20.00 Midway Island, USA
     IU  TIXI   71.6341  128.8667   40.00 Tiksi, Russia

DATA SEARCH
-----------

**Data for 1 hour after event origin**

Once the event or time range and stations are identified, downloading
data is straight forward.  First, the event is determined; here we use
the 1994 deep Bolivian event and a station named *DOOR*. Data requests
need to specific where the data should be placed; this includes
*miniSEED* for directly saving the miniSEED files, *SAC* for
converting the miniSEED files into SAC binary format, and *READ* for
placing the data directly into memory.  Any combination of these
options can be used. We also specify the duration of the data be
downloaded using the *DURATION* option::

     SAC> event time 1994/160 1d mag 8 gcmt
     Origin              Lat.   Lon.    Depth  Mag.     Agency EventID

**Data download using a station file**

If a stations file exists, data for these can be directly
downloaded. Let's create the stations file, then download the data.  We
also save the data request using the *OUT* parameter in DATA_, then
immediately use that request file

Create a station file call net_BK.txt::

     SAC> station net BK region -125 -110 30 40 sta B*,C* out net_BK.txt
     Warning: Multiple instances of net.sta, likely mutiple epochs
     Net Sta   Lat.     Lon.      Elev.   SiteName

     ...
     BK  CVS    38.3453 -122.4584  295.10 Carmenet Vineyards, Sonoma, CA, USA

Create a request file from the station file::

     SAC> data time 2010,235T00:00:00 1hr in net_BK.txt cha BHZ out net_BK_request.txt
     Reading station file: net_BK.txt

     ...
     BK CVS 00 BHZ 2010-08-23T00:00:00 2010-08-23T01:00:00

     No Data Downloaded, use miniseed, sac, or read to download data

Use the request file to download data, this will automatically download to
miniSSED::

     SAC> data request net_BK_request.txt
     Data Center: NCEDC,http://www.ncedc.org
             Writing data to fdsnws.2019.10.25.18.01.01.NCEDC.mseed [956.00 KiB]

Magic incantations to get the most recent miniSEED file and read it.
These can be avoided by using there READ option in DATA::

     SAC> sc to FILE ls -rt *.mseed | tail -1
     SAC> getbb FILE
      FILE = 'fdsnws.2019.10.25.18.01.01.NCEDC.mseed'

**Applying metadata automatically**

If data is downloaded and converted to sac binary or read into memory,
SAC will try to insert metadata for the resulting data files. ::

**Applying metadata manually**

If data is downloaded without metadata, it is simple to insert that
metadata using the METADATA_ command::

           evdp = 6.471000e+02

INSTRUMENT RESPONSES
--------------------

Responses for specific files is also simple with files read into
memory. Responses can be obtained in sacpz or evalresp format.::

     SAC> read XE.DOOR..BHZ.M.1994.160.003345.sac

     SAC> response sacpz
     Writing data to SAC_PZs_XE_DOOR__BHZ_1994-06-09T00:33:45_1994-06-09T01:33:44 [  1.02 KiB]

     SAC> response evalresp
     Writing data to RESP.XE.DOOR..BHZ [ 49.80 KiB]


COMPUTING TRAVELTIMES
---------------------

Traveltimes can also be retrieved and set using the traveltime Web
Service at IRIS. Just specific the *ONLINE* keyword to the TRAVELTIME_
command::

**Teleseismic Traveltime Example**

Given a region of interest to conduct a teleseismic traveltime
experiment, first find the events 30 to 90 degrees from the region of
interest, Hawaii (Lon: 158W, Lat: 20N).  Here we only look for events
within the last year and magnitude > 7 to limit the results, typically
we use more expansive search parameters.  As this uses a do loop, the
commands need to be contained within a macro ::

     % cat data.sm
     event mag 7  radial -158 21 30 90  usgs time now -1years  to events  outfile events_usgs_m7.xml

     do ev list %events
        message "Event $ev"
        mkdir $ev
        cd $ev
        station $ev cha BHZ outfile stations.txt region -161 -152 18 22
        data $ev  cha BHZ  in stations.txt out request.txt  duration 90m  miniseed
        cd ..
     enddo

     % sac
     SAC> macro data.sm

This should result in a set of directories named with eventids
containing a station file, the data request, and miniseed files to be
unpacked.  Miniseed files can be unpacked, metadata applied, and
traveltime data set using::

     SAC> sc to PWD "basename @$(pwd)"
     SAC> getbb PWD
     SAC> read *.mseed
     SAC> metadata %PWD
     SAC> traveltime online picks 0
     SAC> write over

REDIRECTING SACLST INPUT
------------------------

Let's say you have a list of sac files and you would like to generate a station
list::

  saclst knetwk kstnm stlo stlo stel f *.SAC | \
    awk '{print $2,$3,$4,$5}' | \
	  sort | \
	  uniq > station_lists.txt

To make sure all event locations are consistent for a list of files::

  saclst evlo evla evdp f *.SAC   |  awk '{print $2,$3,$4}' | sort | uniq

Find file that are too short in duration with the longest first::

  saclst b e f *SAC | \
	  awk '{print $1,$2,$3,$3-$2}' | \
	  sort -nr -k +4

Or removing files that are too short in duration::

  mkdir too_short
  for z in $( saclst b e f *SAC | awk '{if($3-$2<30.0){print $1}}'  ) ; do
	  mv $z too_short
  done

Or using xargs::

  saclst b e f *SAC | awk '{if($3-$2<30.0){print $1}} | \
    args -I args mv args too_short


RDSEED - End of Life
--------------------

   Before 2010, the majority of data analysis was done on data sets commonly
   exchanged as SEED volumes, which could be downloaded from the IRIS Data
   Management Center over the Internet.  For the SEED manual, go to
   <http://www.fdsn.org/seed_manual/SEEDManual_V2.4.pdf>.

   Program RDSEED is a legacy utility for reading SEED volumes. This utility
   allows the user to read the contents of the SEED file and convert it to many
   different output formats (including SAC), extracting the data, station
   information, or instrument responses from the file.  Although SEED volumes
   remains the FDSN-approved file format for representing and distributing
   digital seismic data, RDSEED is *End of Life* and no longer supported at
   IRIS. It has now been made an open-source project on *GitHub*
   <https://github.com/iris-edu-legacy/rdseed>.  For further details on RDSEED,
   go to <http://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/software/downloads/rdseed/5-3-1-eol/>.
