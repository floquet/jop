Overview
--------
  SAC (Seismic Analysis Code) is a general-purpose interactive program designed
  for the study of sequential signals, especially time-series data. Emphasis has
  been placed on analysis tools used by research seismologists in the
  detailed study of seismic events. Analysis capabilities include general
  arithmetic operations, Fourier transforms, three spectral estimation
  techniques, IIR and FIR filtering, signal stacking, decimation, interpolation,
  correlation, and seismic phase picking. SAC also contains an extensive
  graphics capability. Binary versions are available for Intel Mac and Linux,
  but SAC can be built from the source code for other computer operating
  systems. The source code is written in C.  For further details regarding
  requirements to build and run SAC, see the README file that
  comes with the distribution.

  SAC was developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and is copyrighted
  by the University of California.  It is currently begin developed and
  maintained by a small group of developers working in cooperation with IRIS.

  In all version of SAC through and including v101.6a, all reals in the
  SAC header/data are single-precision (32 bits; 4 bytes).   SAC v102.0 includes
  double-precision for both time and distance calculations using header
  variables, and does so in a way that maximizes compatibility so that existing
  SAC data files can still be used.  There is a detailed discussion in the
  section on *Floating-Point Precision in SAC* in TUTORIAL_.

  Starting in version 102.0, SAC is capable of viewing and downloading event,
  station, and response metadata and downloading waveforms from the IRIS online
  Web services.  See  `Data Access`_ for an overview.

  Through version 101.6a, epicentral distances were calculated using
  an Earth spheroid defined by a: 6378160.0 m and f: 0.00335293.  In
  version 102.0, a header variable IBODY has been added to allow for
  distance calculations on terrestrial planets, the Sun, and the Moon.
  Options for IBODY are given in the *Event Field* section of `SAC
  Data File Format`_, and an example (macro and output) has been added
  in ${SACHOME}/macros.

  When testing and demonstrating SAC commands, it is useful to have an
  easily-accessible set of seismograms.  The one seismogram most used is from
  command FUNCGEN_: *fg seismo*.  However, all one gets is the first several
  seconds of a not-very-interesting *P* arrival.  Command DATAGEN_ has given
  access to seismograms from three events: a local event, a regional-distance
  event, and an epicentral event.  In SAC v102.0, a new event has been added:
  ${SACHOME}/aux/datagen/SUB/DEEP/: three-component seismograms from eight
  broadband stations.  The arrivals are impulsive, and one can see many
  converted phase.  The help files `SAC_MACROS`_ and  TRAVELTIME_ have examples
  using DATAGEN seismograms.  (The *TRAVELTIME* command has been improved and
  expanded in version 102.0.)

  The Using SAC part of the SAC Users Manual contains general information for
  the new user about what SAC can do, how it works, and how to get started. It
  also contains detailed information for the more experienced user on topics
  such as how to use SAC macros, how to read and write SAC data files from C or
  FORTRAN programs, and how the SAC program is structured.

  The Users Manual will be periodically updated to include new
  descriptions and to revise old ones. Please report any errors in
  this manual to the sac-help listserv: <sac-help@lists.ds.iris.edu>.
  Although the version of the manual that comes with the binary or
  source distribution will be updated only when a new version comes
  out, the online version of the manual at <http://ds.iris.edu/files/
  sac-manual/> can be updated at any time.

Other Sections
--------------
  `Command Reference Manual`_ contains detailed descriptions of each SAC
  command including purpose, syntax, default values, and examples. This manual
  also contains lists of SAC commands sorted alphabetically and functionally.

  `Spectral-Estimation Subprocess Manual`_ describes a subprocess for the
  study of stationary random processes. A subprocess is like a small separate
  program within the main SAC program.

  `Signal-Stacking Subprocess Manual`_ describes a subprocess for performing
  signal stacking with delays, traveltimes, and record section plots.

Notation
--------
  Repeating an important point made above, you may enter keywords and options in
  either uppercase or lowercase. SAC converts these to uppercase before
  interpreting them. The exceptions to this rule are text appearing within
  single or double quotes and the names of directories and files. The case of
  these items is not changed. They are interpreted literally.
