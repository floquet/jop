MERGE
+++++

SUMMARY
-------
Merges (concantenates) a set of files to data in memory.

SYNTAX
------
::

  MERGE {VERBOSE} {GAP ZERO|INTERP} {OVERLAP COMPARE|AVERAGE}
       {TOLERANCE_DELTA v} {filelist}

INPUT
-----

   :GAP ZERO | INTERP: How to handle data gaps

       - ZERO - Fill with 0.0 amplitude [default]
       - INTERP - Interpolate, linear, within the data gap

   :OVERLAP COMPARE | AVERAGE: How to handle data overlaps

       - COMPARE - Compare overlapping data points, exit on mismatch
       - AVERAGE - Average overlapping data points

   :TOLERANCE_DELTA v: Tolerance between computed delta and delta
       reported in the header.  Default tolerance is 1e-6

   :VERBOSE: Describe the merge details

   :filelist:  A list of SAC binary data files.  This list may contain
       simple filenames, full or relative pathnames, and wildcard
       characters.  See the READ_ command for a complete description.


DESCRIPTION
-----------
   The data in the files in this merge list is appended or concantenated to the
   data in memory.  Each pair of files to be merged is checked to make sure they
   have the same sampling interval and station name.  Any number of file, in any
   order are able to be merged.  Data currently in memory and data identified in
   the merge command are merged together.  If no data is specified with the 
   merge command, data currently in memory will be merged.

TOLERANCE_DELTA
---------------
   For collections of files with high sample rates, long durations or both
   the computation of time becomes less precise due to the limited precision
   of the delta value in the header.

   To avoid this, a calculatd time-sampling is computed based on the
   difference in begin times and with sufficient precision.  If the
   calculated time-sampling is within the tolerance specified by the
   TOLERANCE_DELTA, then the calculated time-sampling is used in
   place of the value reported in the header.  Use VERBOSE for more
   information about the calculated and header-defined deltas::

     SAC> merge verbose  ./*.SAC
       merge calculating delta
       merge calculated delta: 4.000000000000000e-03 (assuming no-gaps)
             delta in header 4.000000189989805e-03 (first file)
             difference: 1.899898e-10 = abs( calc_delta - delta )
             tolerance:  1.000000e-06
             using calulcted delta
       merging 24 files => 3600000 data points

   The calculated delta assumes no gaps and no overlaps for the input files
   as is determined as ::

      calc_delta = mean ( (file_{i+1}.b - file_{i}.b) / file_{i}.npts )

   where the file_{i} comes before file_{i+1}.

   To turn off computing the observed delta, use a value of <= 0.0 ::

     SAC r *SAC
     SAC> merge verbose tol 0.0 
     merging 24 files => 3599999 data points
     merge: Gap zero fill: [n: 899999 t: 3599.996171]
     merge: Gap zero fill: [n: 1049999 t: 4199.996199]
     .....

  As soon as a significant gap or overlap is found between two files,
  all successive file boundaries will have a significant gap or
  overlap as the mismatch will increase with increasing n.  In this
  data set, each file has 150000 points with a dt of 0.004s.

  The output of Merge is a single file with the same name as the first
  file, so it was necessary to use the read statement.

EXAMPLES
--------
   To merge FILE3, FILE4, FILE1 and FILE2 into one file::

      SAC> READ FILE1 FILE2
      SAC> MERGE FILE3 FILE4

   or::

      SAC> READ FILE1 FILE2 FILE3 FILE4
      SAC> MERGE

   or::

      SAC> DELETECHANNEL ALL
      SAC> MERGE FILE1 FILE2 FILE3 FILE4

   To merge files for the same station, say ELKO.Z, from four different events
   each stored in a separate UNIX directory::

      SAC> READ data/event1/elko.z
      SAC> MERGE data/event2/elko.z data/event3/elko.z data/event4/elko.z
