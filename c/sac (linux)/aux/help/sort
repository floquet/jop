SORT
++++

SUMMARY
-------
Sorts files in memory by header fields.

SYNTAX
------
::

  SORT header {ASCEND|DESCEND} {header {ASCEND|DESCEND} ... }

INPUT
-----
   :HEADER:  header field upon which to sort the files.

   :ASCEND:  Sort files on header in ascending order. This is the default.

   :DESCEND: Sort files on header in descending order

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   Sort the files in memory in order according to the header field given.
   The earlier a header field appears on the command line, the higher priority
   that field will receive in the sort, the first field receiving the highest
   priority, and subsequent fields used to break ties.  No more than five
   header fields may be entered.  Each may be followed by either ASCEND or
   DESCEND to indicate the direction of the sort on that particular field.
   If neither ASCEND nor DESCEND is specified, ASCEND will be used by default.
   If Sort is called without specifying any header fields, it will sort on
   the fields specified in the previous call to SORT_.  If the first call to
   SORT_ is without any header fields, it will produce error 1379.


DEFAULTS
--------
It is presumed that all sorts will be in ascending order unless DESCEND
is specified on the command line.
