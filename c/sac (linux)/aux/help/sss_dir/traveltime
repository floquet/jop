SSSTRAVELTIME
+++++++++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Computes traveltime of selected phases for pre-defined velocity models
Description and examples assume the calls are made from within SSS.
The source file is the same as the non-SSS version, and this file has
only an example that uses SSS plotting.  For the full description, see
TRAVELTIME_.

EXAMPLE
-------
This example is the same traveltime run as in TRAVELTIME_, but here
for the final plot we use PLOTRECORDSECTION_::

     SAC> datagen sub deep  bla.r kev.r kip.r pas.r ; rtr
     SAC> SSS
     SAC/SSS> traveltime quiet picks 0 phase sPP
     SAC/SSS> traveltime  quiet picks 1 phase P pP sP S sS SKS
     SAC/SSS> dw units degrees fixed 50 90 ;  tw 400 1500
     SAC/SSS> prs orient port ttime on labels kstcmp
     SAC/SSS> save sakhalin-picks-prs.xpm

One must put SAC files in memory before entering SSS.  We use the
default aspect ratio in *prs*, so if we had used SAVEIMG_ to create a
PDF file, the output plot would have errors.
