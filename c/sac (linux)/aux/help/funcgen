FUNCGEN
+++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Generates a function and stores it in memory.

SYNTAX
------
::

  FUNCGEN {type},{DELTA v},{NPTS n},{BEGIN v}

where type is one of the following::

  IMPULSE
  STEP
  BOXCAR
  TRIANGLE
  SINE {frequency phase}
  LINE {slope intercept}
  QUADRATIC {a b c}
  CUBIC {a b c d}
  SEISMOGRAM
  RANDOM {nfiles seed}
  IMPSTRIN {n1 n2 ... nN}

INPUT
-----
   :IMPULSE:  Impulse at central data point.

   :IMPSTRIN:  A series of impulses at the specified sample points.

   :STEP:  Step function.  Zero in first half.  One in second half.

   :BOXCAR:  Boxcar function.  Zero in first and last thirds.  One in
       middle third.

   :TRIANGLE:  Triangle function.  Zero in first and last quarters.
       Linearly increasing from zero to one in second quarter and
       decreasing from one to zero in third quarter.

   :SINE {frequency phase}:  Sine wave with frequency in Hz and phase
       angle in degrees.  Amplitude is one.

       **Note** There is a factor of 2*pi in the phase argument::

          function = 1.0 * sin (2 * Pi * f * t)

   :LINE {slope intercept}:  Linear function with slope given and intercept

   :QUADRATIC {a b c}:  Quadratic function of the form:
       ::

         a*t^{2} + b*t + c

   :CUBIC {a b c d}:  Cubic function of the form:
       ::

         a*t^{3} + b*t^{2} + c*t + d

   :SEISMOGRAM: Sample seismogram.  This differs from other function
       options for fg in that there are no further options. Specifically,
       DELTA, NPTS, and BEGIN options are ignored for seismogram (abbreviated
       seis).

   :RANDOM {nfiles seed}:  Random sequence (Gausian white noise) generator.
       Number of random sequence files to generate is first and the
       "seed" used to generate the first random number is second.  This seed value is
       stored in USER0 so that you can regenerate the same random sequence
       at a later time if desired.

       **Note** This is not really random, not even psuedo-random.

   :DELTA v:  Set increment between samples to v.  Stored in header as
       DELTA.

   :NPTS n:  Set number of data points in function to n.  Stored in header
       as NPTS.

   :BEGIN v:  Set begin time to v.  Stored in header as BEGIN.

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------
::

      FUNCGEN IMPULSE NPTS 100 DELTA 1.0 BEGIN 0.
      FUNCGEN SINE 0.05 0.0
      FUNCGEN LINE 1 1
      FUNCGEN QUADRATIC 1 1 1
      FUNCGEN CUBIC 1 1 1
      FUNCGEN RANDOM 1 12357
      FUNCGEN SEISMO [there are no further options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
   Executing this command is equivalent to reading a single file (except for the
   RANDOM option in which more than one file can be generated) into memory whose
   name is the name of the function generated.  Any data previously in memory is
   destroyed.  Other functions will be added as needed.

   Any command which loads data into memory is monitored to maintain a
   level of confidence in the event infomation when transfered from the SAC
   data buffer to the CSS data buffer.  When FUNCGEN_ is used, the confidence
   is set to LOW, indicating that SAC should consider any matching event IDs
   as artifacts and reassign the event ID of the incoming file.  For more
   details, use HELP_ READ_.


HEADER CHANGES

   generated.
