PLOTPK_ Cursor Options
----------------------

======== =====================================================================
char     meaning
======== =====================================================================
a        Designate first arrival in header {1,7}.
b        Display previous plot (if there is one).
c        Evaluate first arrival and end of event {1,4,7}.
d        Set phase direction to DOWN (precedes P or S phase pick).
e        Set phase onset to EMERGENT (precedes P or S phase pick)
f        Define end of event {1,2,3,7}..
g        Display picks to terminal in HYPO format {4}.
h        If CHPF_ precedes call to PLOTPK_, write picks to HYPO pick file {3,4}.
i        Set phase onset to IMPULSIVE (precedes P or S phase pick).
j        Set noise level {2,6,8}.
l        Saves and lists x and y values for cursor location {2,4}.
m        Compute maximum amplitude waveform {2,3,5}.
n        Display next plot (if there is one).
o        Zoom Out => Displays previous plot window.
           A maximum of five windows are saved.
p        Designate P wave arrival time {1,2,3,7}.
q        Terminate PLOTPK immediately.
s        Designate S wave arrival time {1,2,3,7}.
t        Designate user time Tn in header {1,2,7}.
           Next keystroke should be an integer between 0 and 9.
u        Set phase direction to UP (precedes P or S phase pick).
v        Define a Wood-Anderson waveform {2,5}.
w        Define a general waveform {2,5}.
x        Set Zoom window
           - Set beginning of zoomed plot
           - If x is second keystroke, set end of zoomed window and display
           - If s is second keystroke, defined zoomed plot limits are saved
             and used as xlims for subsequent plots

z        Set zero (reference) level {2,6,8}.  If reference is on with a value
             f, two more horizontal lines are drawn at +/- f from the z line.
'+'      Set phase direction to PLUS (precedes P or S phase pick).
'-'      Set phase direction to MINUS (precedes P or S phase pick).
' '      Set the phase direction to NEUTRAL (precedes P or S phase pick).
'n'      Set phase quality to n, n=0,1,2,3, or 4. (precedes P or S phase pick)

Notes
-----

  - {1} Written to SAC header.
  - {2} Written to alphanumeric pick file if open.
  - {3} Written to HYPO pick file if open.
  - {4} Written to terminal window.
  - {5} Terminal echo is a box encompassing waveform.
  - {6} Place horizontal cursor at designated level before typing command letter.
  - {7} Terminal window echo is a labeled vertical line.
  - {8} Terminal window echo is a labeled horizontal line.
