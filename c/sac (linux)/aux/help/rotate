ROTATE
++++++

SUMMARY
-------
Rotates a pair of data components through an angle.

SYNTAX
------
::

  ROTATE {to GCP|TO v|THROUGH v|,{NORMAL|REVERSED}

INPUT
-----
   :TO GCP:  Rotate to the "great circle path".  Both components must be
       horizontals.  The station and event coordinates header fields must
       be defined.

   :TO v:  Rotate to the angle v (degrees).  Both components must be
       horizontals.

   :THROUGH v:  Rotate through the angle v in degrees.  One component may
       be vertical.

   :NORMAL: Output (horizontal) components with the second leading the
       first by 90 degrees (clockwise rotation looking down).

   :REVERSED: Output (horizontal) components with the second lagging
        the first by 90 degrees (counterclockwise rotation looking down).

DEFAULT VALUES
--------------
::

  ROTATE TO GCP NORMAL

DESCRIPTION
-----------
  Pairs of data components are rotated in this command.  Each pair must
  have the same station and event header variables, NPTS, B, and DELTA

  **TO option**: Both components must be horizontals: CMPAZ must be
  defined and CMPINC must be 90 degrees.  After the rotation is
  completed, the first component of each pair will be directed along
  the angle given after the TO keyword.  If the TO GCP option is used,
  the station and header fields STLA, STLO, EVLA, and EVLO must be
  defined so that the backazimuth (BAZ) can be calculated.  After the
  rotation, the first component will be directed along the angle given
  by the station-event backazimuth plus or minus 180 degrees (to keep
  the final angle between 0 and 360 degrees).  This component
  therefore points from the event toward the station (the *radial*
  direction), and the second component is called "transverse" or
  "tangential".  (The (upward) vertical, radial, and transverse
  directions form a left-handed coordinate system.)

  The NORMAL and REVERSED options apply only to horizontal rotations.
  If the NORMAL option is used, the second component leads the first
  by 90 degrees.  If the REVERSED option is used, it lags the first by
  90 degrees.  ROTATE TO GCP REVERSED results in a transverse
  component in the opposite direction from ROTATE TO GCP NORMAL, a
  convention preferred by some researchers.

EXAMPLES
--------
  To rotate a pair of horizontals to a specified angle for the first component::

      SAC> READ XYZ.N XYZ.E
      SAC> ROTATE TO 123.43

  To rotate two sets of horizontals so that the first component in each set
  along the great circle path and then write SAC files for the radial and
  transverse components::

      SAC> READ ABC.N ABC.E DEF.N DEF.E
      SAC> ROTATE TO GCP
      SAC> W ABC.R ABC.T DEF.R DEF.T

ERROR MESSAGES
--------------
- 1301: No data files read in.
- 2001: Command requires an even number of data files.
- 2004: Insufficient header information for rotation:

  - STLA, STLO, EVLA, EVLO must be defined for GCP option.

- 2002: Following files are not an orthogonal pair:
- 2003: Following files are not both horizontals:

  - TO option only works on horizontals.
